    <p id=tipstext>YOU CAN TAKE REALLY GOOD PICTURES OF YOUR ROSES!!!
•	Merv Gibson                       mervgibsonimages.com
•	You and Your Camera
•	Cell Phone
•	Point and Shoot
•	Interchangeable Lens: 
?	Single Lens Reflex (frame shot through lens via mirror/eye piece)
?	Single Lens No-reflex (no mirror, frame shot on display screen)
•	How Your Camera Works
•	Rose’s reflected light goes through the lens onto a chip that converts the light into a digital code.
•	The camera has three ways to adjust how light affects the chip
?	Aperture setting (f stop): how wide the shutter opens: 
f4.0 = large shutter opening; f22 = small shutter opening
?	Time: how long the shutter stays open
?	ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
Chip sensitivity to light: ISO 100 = least sensitive
ISO 200, 400, 800, 1600 are common settings. The higher the number, the more sensitive to light. The lower the number, the longer the shutter will stay open.
•	Set Camera to Aperture Mode  
•	Set your camera to “A” or Aperture Priority.
The camera’s brain will automatically adjust “T” or shutter speed.
?	Choose “Landscape” or Aperture setting (F Stop) of at least 16 to maximize sharpness of entire blossom.
•	Set your camera’s ISO to 400 or choose “variable” to allow camera to set ISO for each shot.
•	Put camera on tripod (!!!) to get a sharp picture. 
•	Choose Your Rose
•	Select rose to photograph as if you were a rose show judge.
•	Would you take this rose to a rose show? The photo can be no better than the chosen subject.
•	Is the foliage quality equal to that of the blossom?
•	Think: “I will submit this photo in the ? contest category.
•	 What ribbon should I expect for this rose?
•	Indoor or Outdoor Photo
•	Indoor (in a vase?): Flash or Natural Light
•	Outdoor
?	Morning, Noon, or Dusk
?	Sun or Shade
?	Flash
?	Wind Mitigation
•	What is Behind Your Rose?
•	Will the background detract from the beauty of the rose?
•	Is the background close to or distant from the rose?
•	Can you move for a better background shot?
•	Add a background screen to your photo equipment? 
•	Consider the Light
•	What time is it?
•	Where is the sun?
•	Is the sun shining on my rose?
•	Is my rose in the shade?
•	Is there a shadow on part of the rose?
•	Hold the Camera Still!
•	Hold the camera in both hands.
•	Lock your arms against your chest.
•	USE A TRIPOD!!!
•	Frame the Shot
•	Photograph blossom with foliage or blossom alone?
•	Consider angle of camera to blossom.
•	Point your camera at your rose.
•	Now, zoom in or move closer to fill the frame.
•	Use the “Rule of Thirds” as a guide: no bullseye! 
Rule of Thirds Definition: think tic-tac-toe
Locate point of interest near where the lines intersect.
•	Focus on the Right Spot
•	Divide the rose into (vertical) thirds.
•	Focus on the division line nearest to the camera.
?	1/3 of the photo nearest the camera
will be in focus.
?	2/3 of the photo farthest from camera
will be in focus.
