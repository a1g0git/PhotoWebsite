        <p>Merv enjoys taking scenic photos of Lowcountry birds, gardens and landscapes. You may have seen one of his photos featured as an "Editor's Pick" in the Post-Courier newspaper gallery of reader submissions. Friends often ask him to photograph their events or gardens. One gardening group featured him as a speaker on how its members could take better photos of their own flowers. Check out some of his tips on this website. Or click on the "buy" tab to purchase affordable ($2.99) digital images from his web store.</p><br>
